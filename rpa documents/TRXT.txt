Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionized numerous industries, and one of its most significant contributions is in the field of machine learning, particularly classification models. Classification models are a subset of machine learning that enable computers to categorize data into specific classes or categories.
Computer Scientist David Wolpert explains in his paper, The Lack of A Priori Distinctions Between Learning Algorithms. Neural Computation, that:
"For each problem, you must select the right algorithm. Your question is how to do this. If you have plenty of computational resources, you can test multiple algorithms and parameter settings. In this approach, the main question is how to estimate and compare the performance of the algorithms in a reliable way."
